## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction:**
   - The user accesses the chatbot via the web-based UI and submits a query in Finnish or English.

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - The backend server receives the query and first detects the language using `langdetect`.
   
3. **Retrieval Phase:**
   - The query is passed to the Retrieval System.
   - The system generates an embedding for the query and performs a similarity search using FAISS.
   - The top `k` relevant document chunks are retrieved based on similarity scores.

4. **Generation Phase:**
   - The retrieved document chunks and the original query are formatted into a prompt.
   - The prompt is sent to Cohere's language model via API.
   - The language model generates a coherent and contextually relevant response.

5. **Response Delivery:**
   - The generated response is sent back to the backend server.
   - The backend sends the response to the UI, where it is displayed to the user.

6. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - All interactions are logged for monitoring, analytics, and potential debugging.

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Management:**
  - Cohere API keys are managed via environment variables and not hard-coded into the source code.
  - Utilize Docker secrets or environment variable management tools for enhanced security in production.
  
- **Input Validation:**
  - Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
  
- **Secure Communication:**
  - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission between the client and server.
  - Ensure that any external API communications (e.g., with Cohere) are encrypted.
  
- **Access Controls:**
  - Restrict access to the backend server and API endpoints as necessary.
  - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms if exposing sensitive functionalities.

## Scalability and Performance

- **Scalable Architecture:**
  - The modular design allows for individual components to be scaled horizontally based on demand (e.g., multiple backend servers, FAISS clusters).
  
- **Efficient Retrieval:**
  - FAISS provides high-performance similarity searches, enabling quick retrieval even with large datasets.
  
- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - Future enhancements can include asynchronous request handling to improve response times and handle high concurrency.
  
- **Caching Mechanisms:**
  - Implement caching strategies for frequently asked queries to reduce latency and API usage costs.
  
- **Resource Optimization:**
  - Optimize Docker containers for minimal resource usage, enabling deployment on various infrastructures, including cloud platforms.
